### A Grammar of Lothama Djamon

This document outlines the core phonology, morphology, and syntax of **Lothama Djamon**

---

## 1. Phonology

_Internal: The sound system is distinctively Germanic/Norse, characterized by hard consonants, distinctive clusters, and a clear vowel system._

### 1.1 Consonant Inventory
| Category | Sounds | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stops**         | `/p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/` |                              |
| **Fricatives**    | `/f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /θ/, /h/` | `/θ/` spelled **th**         |
| **Affricates**    | `/dʒ/`                        | spelled **dj** — "hard J"    |
| **Nasals**        | `/m/, /n/`                    |                              |

## 2. Morphology

Words are primarily formed through **compounding** and **suffixation**.

### 2.1 Pluralization

The language distinguishes between **standard multiplicity** and an **“Epic/Mythic” totality**.

#### Plural Types

| Type | Suffix | Rule / Usage | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard plural   | `-en`      | General plural marker                             | `Kin` → `Kinen` (“children”)                  |
|                   |            |                                                   | `Flam` → `Flamen` (“flames”)                  |
| Irregular plural  | `-an`      | Used for certain roots ending in nasals           | `Ram` → `Raman` (“lands”)                     |
| Epic plural       | `-era/-ara`| Indicates “all” or a totality of the concept      | `Jor` → `Jorera` (“all life”)                 |
|                   |            |                                                   | `Ram` → `Ramara` (“all lands”)                |

### 2.2 Derivational Suffixes

These suffixes transform nouns into **agents**, **locations**, or **descriptive concepts**.

| Suffix | Function | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-sk`  | Adjectival   | “Having the quality of”              | `Flam` + `-sk` → `Flamsk` (“fiery / burned”)               |
| `-kel` | Abstract     | State of being / essence             | `Sno` (snow) + `-kel` → `Snoskel` (“Winter”)               |
| `-ar`  | Agentive     | “One who does” / “the doer”          | `Vorn` (guard) + `-ar` → `Vornar` (“watcher”)              |

### 2.3 Compounding Rules

Compounding is the **primary method** of vocabulary expansion.  
In all compounds, **the first root is the HEAD (core concept)** and the **second root is the MODIFIER (descriptor)**,

> **HEAD ROOT + MODIFIER ROOT**  
> Meaning: “X Y” → **“X that is characterized by Y.”**

- **Rule 1: Consonant Harmonization**  
When the **head root** ends with the same consonant the **modifier root** begins with, they merge into a **single instance**, but **semantic roles do not change**.
  - `Ram` (land, HEAD) + `Marei` (sea / water, MODIFIER) → `Ramarei`  
    - **Literal**: land-sea → **“coast”**

- **Rule 2: Semantic Hierarchy (Head–Modifier)**  
  The **first root is always the head noun**, and the **second root is the modifier**.  
  Together, they form a “head described by modifier” unit, mirroring noun + adjective phrases.
  - `Ram` (land — HEAD) + `Zel` (river — MODIFIER) → `Ramzel`  
    - **Literal**: “river-land” → **“riverlands; lands defined by a river.”**  
  - `Vura` (thread — HEAD) + `Tagna` (knot — MODIFIER) → `Vuratagna`  
    - **Literal**: “thread-knot” → **“the binding knot of thread; fate; destiny.”**
  - `Girde` (burden — HEAD) + `Svar` (answer — MODIFIER) → `Girdesvar`  
    - **Literal**: “burden-answer” → **“responsibility; obligation; accountability.”**

### 2.4 Derivational Prefixes

These prefixes derive **resultative** and **causative / applicative** meanings from nominal roots.

| Prefix | Function | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ge-` | Resultative | Marks a state of “having been given X / entrusted with X” (externally assigned, completed). | `Girdesvar` → `Gegirdesvar` (“the one entrusted; having been given responsibility”). |
| `far-` | Causative / applicative | “To give X; to cause another to have X; to apply X to someone.” | `Girdesvar` → `Fargirdesvar Kin` (“to entrust the child; to give the child responsibility”). |

Example sentences with tense particles:

- `Sommar ta Gegirdesvar.` — “Sommar had been given responsibility / was entrusted with responsibility.”
- `Sommar ka Fargirdesvar Kin.` — “Sommar is giving the child responsibility / is entrusting the child.”
- `Sommar zo Fargirdesvar Kin.` — “Sommar will give the child responsibility / will entrust the child.”

## 3. Syntax

Lothama Djamon utilizes a **strict word order** with **analytic tense marking**.

### 3.1 Word Order

Basic clause structure:

> **S – V – O** (Subject – Verb – Object)

Example:

- `Sommar ta run ram.`  
  - **Gloss**: `Sommar` (Sommar, Subj) `ta` (past) `run` (walked, Verb) `ram` (land, Obj)  
  - **Translation**: “Summer walked the land.”

### 3.2 Tense Particles

Verbs do **not** conjugate. Tense is indicated by a **particle placed immediately before the verb**.

| Particle | Tense / Aspect | Example | Translation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ta`     | Past                     | `Sommar ta run.`     | “Sommar walked.”                    |
| `ka`     | Continuous / Present     | `Zel ka run.`        | “The river flows / is flowing.”     |
| `zo`     | Future / Intention       | `Sommar zo flam.`    | “Sommar will burn.”                 |

### 3.3 Noun Modification (Descriptors)

Adjectives and other descriptors **follow the noun** (post-nominal position).

Examples:

- `Ram flamsk` → “land fiery/burned” → **“the burned land”**

### 3.4 Possession

Possession is marked by **juxtaposition** in the order:

> **Possessed + Possessor**

Examples:

 - `Kardj Sommar` → “heart [of] Sommar”
- `Zel Vinta` → “river [of] winter”

## 4. Lexicon Expansion

### 4.1 Glossary Additions (Suggested)

_Internal note (lexicon design): When no suitable Lothama Djamon root or compound can be formed from existing material, new **root words** may be coined directly from Germanic or Norse sources, then lightly adapted to Lothama Djamon phonology and stress patterns._
