## A Primer for the Sojourner

### An Introductory Guide to Lothama Djamon and the Ordered Ways of Ram Djamon

Prepared by the Imperial Academy of Sarasia for the Newly Arrived.


## Preface

In reverent duty and with ordered mind, the Imperial Academy of Sarasia sets forth this humble primer for those who have, by design unknown, crossed from other worlds into the lands called **Ram Djamon**. By immutable decree of the Crimson Throne, any human so delivered into **Ram Djamon** shall abide within its bounds and may not depart to former realms.

This work is dedicated, with unbroken loyalty and filial awe, to 

**Her Everlasting Majesty Katira Sarasia,**  
**Eternal Empress of the Djamon Realm;**  
**Queen of Sarasia;**  
**Guardian-Mother of the Kin Ram;**  
**and Matron of the Elderborn.**

May every clear word and every rightly ordered thought within these pages stand as a small tribute to Her undying reign.

To the reader: you have arrived among a people ancient in memory and steadfast in custom. Your former homeland lies beyond recall. You are bound to this Realm not by your choosing, but by decree; yet by the mercy of the Crimson Throne and the labor of scholars, a path is laid before you, that you might learn to speak, to live, and to walk in good order amidst the children of this land.

The language here taught is called **Lothama Djamon**, “the tongue of the Djamon.” It is honored throughout the Empire as a bond of understanding among many peoples. In your case, it is not ornament but necessity: those who would dwell lawfully and safely within **Ram Djamon** must, in due time, learn its tongue and customs.

For a short season, the Academy and its appointed guides will walk beside you, offering instruction and shelter. That season will pass. Thereafter, you will be expected to order your own steps, bearing yourself with clarity and restraint among the peoples of the Realm.

## Chapter I – The Realm and Its Peoples

The **Djamon Realm** is a vast imperial dominion stretching over lands of stone, river, and sea. Its heart is the line of **Sarasia**, from which **Her Everlasting Majesty** descends. Around this heart are many peoples and provinces, bound together by law, duty, and the shared reverence owed to the Crimson Throne.

Among these peoples, two are of first note for the newcomer:

- **Sarasia**: the Empress’s ancestral folk. They dwell in greatest number near the imperial centers of learning and governance. Their features are said to resemble most closely those of Her Majesty. Many high officers of the Empire, and a great portion of the nobility near the capital, are of Sarasian blood.

- **Kin Ram**: called the **“Children of the Land.”** They are numerous, diverse, and widespread across the Empire’s fields, valleys, and riverlands. They till the **Ram** (land), guard its borders, and provide many of the soldiers, artisans, and stewards upon whom the Realm depends.

- **Elderborn**: an ancient and seldom-seen people of old lineage, marked by large appearance and a deep bond with **Ram** and memory. Most Djamon will pass their days without standing in their presence.

In all these ranks, from Sarasia in the courts to Kin Ram upon the soil, one principle is constant: **duty before self, harmony before pride, and clear speech before confusion.** The tongue you will learn is both a tool and a measure of your place. To speak carefully is to honor the Empress, your hosts, and the land that now sustains you.

## Chapter II – First Words in Lothama Djamon

### 1. On Names and Meanings

The words that follow are not presented as cold marks on a page, but as doors into the mind of the Realm. A few of the most important roots are:

- **Djamon** – “the people”; also used for the race called Djamon.  
- **Ram** – “land.”  
- **Kin** – “child.”  
- **Jor** – “life.”  
- **Sommar** – “Summer” (the season of life).  
- **Zel** – “river.”  
- **Marei** – “sea.”  
- **Flam** – “flame, fire; to burn.”  
- **Kardj** – “heart” (the beating heart within the chest).  

Other important words describe qualities or states:

- **Kardjsk** – “kind-hearted, compassionate.”  
- **Flamsk** – “fiery, burned.”  
- **Snoskel** – “Winter; the state of snow.”  

In time, you will learn many more.

### 2. The Shape of a Simple Sentence

In ordinary speech, a basic statement in Lothama Djamon follows this clear order:

> **Subject – Word of Time – Action – Object**

You may think of this as **S – T – A – O**, where:

- **Subject**: the one who acts.  
- **Word of Time**: a short word that tells whether the action is past, present, or intended.  
- **Action**: what is done.  
- **Object**: the thing or place affected.

Consider:

- `Elaira ta run ram.`  
  - Words: `Elaira` `ta` (past) `run` (walked) `ram` (land).  
  - Meaning: “Elaira walked the land.”

Here, **Elaira** is the subject, **ta** is the word of time for the past, **run** is the action “walked,” and **ram** is the land that receives the action. This pattern of ordered clarity is beloved in imperial instruction.

Another example:

- `Zel ka run.`  
  - Words: `Zel` (river) `ka` (present / ongoing) `run` (flows).  
  - Meaning: “The river flows; the river is flowing.”

As you read and listen, train your mind to ask: *Who is acting? When? What is done? To what or to whom?* Thus you will soon hear the order even when you do not yet know every word.

## Chapter III – The Land, the River, and the Fire

The peoples of the Empire live close to their lands and seasons. It is fitting, therefore, that many of your earliest words should name these things.

### 1. Words of Land and Water

- **Ram** – land.  
- **Raman** – lands (more than one).  
- **Ramara** – “all lands,” the lands taken together in a great totality.  
- **Zel** – river.  
- **Marei** – sea.  
- **Ramzel** – “riverlands,” lands marked by a river.  
- **Ramarei** – coast or “water-land,” where land and sea meet.

Simple examples:

- `Ram flamsk.` – “The land is burned.”  
- `Zel ka run.` – “The river flows.”  
- `Elaira ta run Ramzel.` – “Elaira walked the riverlands.”  

Such short statements, though plain, are worthy practice. They teach you to see the world as the Djamon see it: as **Ram**, shaped by **Zel** and **Marei**, watched by those who bear duty.

### 2. Words of Fire and Season

- **Flam** – flame, fire; to burn.  
- **Flamen** – flames (many flames).  
- **Flamsk** – fiery, burned.  
- **Sno** – snow.  
- **Snoskel** – Winter, “the state of snow.”

Examples:

- `Flam ka run.` – “The fire is burning.”  
- `Flamen ta flam Ram.` – “The flames burned the land.”  
- `Ram flamsk.` – “The land is burned / fiery.”  
- `Snoskel ta run Ram.` – “Winter went over the land.”

These are not merely exercises of the tongue. They echo poems and tales known throughout the Empire, wherein summers walk, rivers speak, and winters pass over the fields of the Kin Ram.

## Chapter IV – On Being and Doing

The Djamon place careful weight upon the difference between what a thing **is** in its nature, and what it **does** in a moment. This distinction will guide your speech and your conduct alike.

### 1. Speaking of What Something Is

To speak of a lasting state, identity, or enduring trait, Lothama Djamon uses the small word **ra**, placed between the thing spoken of and the word that describes it.

The pattern is:

> **Thing – ra – Descriptor**

Examples:

- `Djamon ra kardjsk.` – “The person is kind-hearted.”  
- `Elaira ra vornar.` – “Elaira is a watcher.”  

Here, **ra** tells us not of a passing mood, but of something more settled: the heart’s enduring quality, or the settled role of a person.

Sometimes, especially in solemn writing or carved words, this “is” may be left unspoken. One might find:

- `Ram flamsk.` – literally “Land burned.”  

In such a case, the meaning “is” is understood, as if it were written:

- `Ram ra flamsk.` – “The land is burned.”

The silence itself is a kind of dignity, used when the trait is beyond question.

### 2. Speaking of What Happens in Time

To speak of change and action, the language places a short word of time before the verb. Three of greatest importance for the beginner are:

- **ta** – marks a completed action in the past.  
- **ka** – marks an ongoing or present action.  
- **zo** – marks a future action or intention.

The pattern is:

> **Thing – Word of Time – Action – (Object)**

Observe the contrast:

- `Djamon ka kardjsk.` – “The person is being kind right now; is acting kindly.”  
- `Djamon ra kardjsk.` – “The person is kind-hearted.”  

In the first, **ka** draws our eyes to the present behavior. In the second, **ra** tells us of the person’s deeper nature. The Empire holds both as important: the heart that loves kindness, and the outward acts that prove it.

Further examples:

- `Elaira ta run Ram.` – “Elaira walked the land.”  
- `Elaira ka run Ram.` – “Elaira is walking the land.”  
- `Elaira zo run Ram.` – “Elaira will walk the land.”  

In all these, the clear order of subject, word of time, action, and object is preserved.

## Chapter V – The Order of Persons and the Weight of Duty

### 1. The Empress and the Line of Sarasia

At the summit of all rank stands **Her Everlasting Majesty Katira Sarasia**, Eternal Empress of the Djamon Realm. From Her flows the law and the right order of the lands. To speak of Her is to tread upon sacred ground; therefore, the newcomer is counseled to do so sparingly and always with full titles in formal company.

Beneath Her, yet high above all lesser rulers, stand the High Kings and High Queens of the ancient High Kingdoms: hereditary sovereigns who hold wide authority within their own lands, but who have sworn binding oaths of loyalty and great-service to the Crimson Throne. You will almost never stand before such a one, yet you should understand that magistrates, wardens, captains, and even village elders bear their small portion of order and **Girdesvar** as a trust handed down through this higher chain of persons—from local lord to greater lord, to High King, and at last to the Empress Herself.

Next stand the high houses of **Sarasia**, whose members often bear heavy charge in governance and war. They are trained from youth in rule, and they look for clarity, sobriety, and restraint in the speech of those who approach them. Rash words before such persons may be remembered long after they are spoken.

Those who have newly come from other worlds stand, for a time, beneath all established houses and ranks in honor and precedence, until their conduct and speech are proven steady. You should therefore think of yourself not as a peer, but as one under watchful mercy, learning how to walk within an order already long established.

### 2. The Kin Ram and the Children of the Land

The **Kin Ram** are called “Children of the Land” because their life is bound to **Ram**. They bear much of the Realm’s toil and defense. A stranger who walks among them should remember that, though their garments may be plain, they also carry **Girdesvar** – the “burden-answer,” or responsibility – for fields, households, and watch-posts.

To speak lightly of the land, or to mock its keepers, is considered a grave discourtesy. A newcomer who gains the trust of Kin Ram neighbors will often find them steadfast friends.

### 3. Duty as Burden and Answer

The word **Girde** means a burden that is carried. The compound **Girdesvar** joins this with **Svar**, “answer,” to express the state of one who must answer for what he or she bears. Thus **Girdesvar** is “responsibility; obligation; accountability.”

From this arise two further forms you may hear:

- **Gegirdesvar** – “one who has been entrusted with responsibility.”  
- **Fargirdesvar** – “to give responsibility to another; to entrust.”

Simple examples:

- `Elaira ra Gegirdesvar.` – “Elaira is the entrusted one.”  
- `Elaira ka Fargirdesvar Kin.` – “Elaira is giving the child responsibility.”  

In imperial thought, it is honorable to carry **Girdesvar**, but shameful to flee from it. This belief shapes manners, law, and teaching throughout the Realm.

## Chapter VI – Speech, Respect, and Everyday Conduct

### 1. On Addressing Superiors

The Empire values measured speech before those of higher station. When speaking with officers, magistrates, and teachers of the Academy, the newcomer is advised to:

- Stand upright, place your hand over your heart and bow with calm steadiness.  
- Speak after being acknowledged, not before.  
- Keep sentences short and clear.  
- Answer questions plainly, and do not press your own questions until invited.  
- Avoid jest until familiar bonds are formed.

In the common tongue of your former world, you may use titles such as “Honored Sir,” “Honored Lady,” or “Esteemed Teacher,” until you are taught their proper equivalents in Lothama Djamon. When referring to Her Everlasting Majesty, avoid all casual mention; in formal recitation, use Her full style as printed in the Preface, which you will in due time be taught to speak in Lothama Djamon. Remember that, until you have shown yourself faithful in duty and speech, your words will be weighed lightly beside those of long-settled subjects.

### 2. On Speaking with Neighbors and the Kin Ram

Among neighbors and those appointed to guide you, speech may be gentler, but should not fall into disorder. The following simple phrases, though here given in mixed form for the beginner, reflect the spirit of courteous exchange:

- “May your **Ram** be at peace this day.”  
- “Your **Kardj** show kindness; I remember it.”  
- “I am new to this **Ram**; teach me, and I will listen.”

As you grow more able, such phrases may be fully shaped in Lothama Djamon, guided by your tutors. The Academy holds that humility in early speech is no disgrace; arrogance in ignorance is.

### 3. On Clarity and Restraint

Regardless of rank, three virtues in speech are praised across the Realm:

1. **Clarity** – words ordered so that meaning is plain.  
2. **Faithfulness** – words that match the truth of things.  
3. **Restraint** – words held back when they would only wound or confuse.

A learner who speaks slowly and clearly, admitting “I do not yet know the word,” is more honored than one who throws out many phrases without care. In time, clear speech and steady conduct will mark you as one who belongs in the ordered peace of the Djamon Realm.

## Chapter VII – First Exercises for the Diligent Sojourner

The following short exercises are offered for private practice. They may be read aloud each day, preferably in a quiet place where the mind may settle.

### 1. Naming and Describing

1. Speak the word `Ram` three times, then say in your own tongue: “This is land.”  
2. Speak `Zel`, then: “This is river.”  
3. Speak `Flam`, then: “This is fire.”  
4. Speak `Djamon`, then: “This is a person.”  

Then attempt the following full statements:

- `Ram flamsk.` – “The land is burned.”  
- `Zel ka run.` – “The river is flowing.”  
- `Djamon ra kardjsk.` – “The person is kind-hearted.”  

Attend as much to the calm ordering of your thoughts as to the sounds themselves.

### 2. Speaking of Time

Practice the three small words of time:

- `ta` – past.  
- `ka` – present and ongoing.  
- `zo` – future or intention.

Combine them with a simple action (here written as `<work>` when the proper verb is unknown to you):

- `Djamon ta <work> Ram.` – “The person worked the land.”  
- `Djamon ka <work> Ram.` – “The person is working the land.”  
- `Djamon zo <work> Ram.` – “The person will work the land.”  

Though the action-word is left as `<work>`, the pattern itself is a worthy object of study.

## Closing Remarks of the Imperial Academy of Sarasia

New-come sojourner, you now hold in your hands the first key to understanding the Djamon Realm. This primer is not a map of every road, but a lantern to show the first steps. In its few words you have glimpsed the land (**Ram**), the rivers (**Zel**), the seasons (**Sommar**, **Snoskel**), the duties (**Girdesvar**), and the hearts (**Kardj**) of the people among whom you now dwell.

The Imperial Academy of Sarasia, established in the early ages of the Empire and confirmed through many ages of Her unbroken reign, receives you for a brief season under its broad mantle. Study these pages with patience. Repeat the examples until they rest easily upon your tongue. Observe the speech and conduct of the Djamon around you with quiet attention, that you may in time walk rightly without close guidance.

May your **Jor** in this new land be rightly ordered. May your words grow clear and your **Kardj** remain steadfast.
